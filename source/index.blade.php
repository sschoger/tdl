			<h3 class="tc1 fw4 ft8">What youâ€™ll learn</h3>
			<p class="lh1 fw4 ft4">One of my biggest objectives with this course is teaching you how to TDD something real.</p>
			<p class="lh1 fw4 ft4">Not just a cookie-cutter to-do app, or an unrealistically stripped down version of some existing product.</p>
			<p class="lh1 fw4 ft4">I'll show you how to design a solid test suite for a real-world, marketable product that you could actually charge money for.</p>
			<p class="lh1 fw4 ft4">We'll cover fundamentals like:</p>
			<ul class="fw4 ft4">
				<li>What test should you write first</li>
				<li>Organizing your test suite</li>
				<li>Feature tests vs. unit tests</li>
				<li>Testing request validations</li>
				<li>Testing authorization rules</li>
				<li>Working with test databases</li>
				<li>Speeding up your tests with test doubles</li>
			</ul>
